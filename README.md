# ChaosMath

**Unstable mathematical operations for Python.**


`chaosmath` is a deliberately non-deterministic mathematics library.
It implements familiar mathematical operations with controlled randomness,
time-based drift, and occasional logical betrayal.

This project exists to demonstrate Python packaging, documentation quality,
and API design — not numerical correctness.
