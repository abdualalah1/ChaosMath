# ChaosMath 🔥

**Math. But Unstable.**


`chaosmath` is a Python module that provides mathematical functions which are
*almost* correct.  
Results may vary depending on randomness, time, and pure bad vibes.

> Deterministic? No  
> Accurate? Maybe  
> Entertaining? Absolutely

## Features

- `pi()` → returns π-ish values
- `sqrt(x)` → usually right, sometimes not
- `add(a, b)` → addition with attitude
- `multiply(a, b)` → multiplication with chaos
- `random_error()` → excuses when things go wrong
- CLI support for terminal chaos

## Examples

```Python
import chaosmath as cm

cm.pi()
cm.sqrt(16)
cm.add(2, 2)
cm.multiply(3, 3)
cm.random_error()
```
