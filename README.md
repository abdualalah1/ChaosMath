# ChaosMath 🔥

**Math. But Unstable.**


`chaosmath` is a Python module that provides mathematical functions which are
*almost* correct.  
Results may vary depending on randomness, time, and pure bad vibes.

- Deterministic? No 
- Accurate? Maybe 
- Entertaining? Ofcourse

You will regret it.

```
or
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/prathambhandary/ChaosMath.git

## Features

- `pi()` → returns π-ish values
- `sqrt(x)` → usually right, sometimes not
- `add(a, b)` → addition with attitude
- `multiply(a, b)` → multiplication with chaos
- `random_error()` → excuses when things go wrong
- CLI support for terminal chaos

---

## Examples

```Python
import chaosmath as cm

print(cm.pi())
print(cm.sqrt(16))
print(cm.add(2, 2))
print(cm.multiply(3, 3))
print(cm.random_error())
```
